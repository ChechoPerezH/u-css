                <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
                <p> Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs,
                    broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers. </p>
                <p> We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                    efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators. </p>
                <p> The CSS Talos Digital invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters.

                    <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
                    <p> There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. Talos aims to excite, inspire, and
                        encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. The HTML
                        remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this
                        can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be,
                        once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers
                        and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                        <h2>Requirements</h2>
                        <p>
                            Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to
                            widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Talos
                            Digital is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable
                            by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now.
                            When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern
                            browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you
                            factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s
                            okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the
                            latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
